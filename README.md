## Front End Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### `npm i`

Install all essential node packages

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## A little background

Sign in with you API key and you would land into home page where you can see all your messages,
all send messages, all received messages and also you would be able to send a new message.
Home page also shows info of your balance.

You can also view details about you message by clicking on read icon in each message.
